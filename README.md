  #QUESTION5:
    To run the Python file containing the Flask application, follow these steps:

          1.Install Flask: If you haven't already installed Flask, you can do so using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal or command                   prompt:
              pip install Flask

          2.Run the Flask application: In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where app.py is located. Then, execute the following command:
            python role_based_api.py
          3.Access the API endpoints: Once the Flask application is running, you can access the defined API endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or your web browser. By                default, Flask runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, so you can access your endpoints by appending the route defined in the Flask application to this base URL.
          
              For example:
          
              To access the GET endpoint to retrieve all students: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/students
              To access the GET endpoint to retrieve a specific student: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/students/{student_id}
              Similarly, you can access other endpoints defined in the application.

         4. Testing: You can test each endpoint with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and headers (e.g., Role header to simulate different user roles) using                 tools like cURL, Postman, or by sending requests programmatically from another Python script.
